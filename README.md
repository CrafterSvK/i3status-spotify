# i3status spotify
Adds spotify artist and song name into i3status. Currently not modulable.
Rust was not meant for this purpose. I will optimize later.

# Run
- Clone directory,
- build application `cargo build --release`,
- add to your .config/i3/config instead of `i3status` -> `i3status | i3spotifystatus-rs`.
